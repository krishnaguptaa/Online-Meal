 ## :trophy: Brief introduction about a project:
<br>
An online shopping mart permits a customer to submit online orders for items and/or services from a store that serves both walk- in customers and online customers. The Online Store System presents an online display of all the items they want to sell. This web based application helps customers to choose their daily needs. Customers provide their complete detail of address and contact so they can get their chosen products at their home. This web application saves lots of time of customers.
<br><br> 
We will be using Html for the front-end. The
styling part will be done using CSS while the functionality will be added using JavaScript.
<br><br>
 Today the era has changed completely and the people are not much interested in going to local stores rather they prefer to shop online. This trend has made a revolutionary change in online shopping industry and today every business organization has their own online store. It has become one of the biggest industries in terms of revenue and customers.
